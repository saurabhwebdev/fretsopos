# Microsoft Clarity Setup

Microsoft Clarity has been installed and integrated into the application.

## Steps to complete setup:

1. Go to [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/)
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Create a new project or use an existing one
4. Copy your Clarity Project ID
5. Open `components/clarity.tsx`
6. Replace `'YOUR_CLARITY_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual Clarity Project ID

Example:
```typescript
clarity.init('abcd1234'); // Replace with your actual ID
```

Once you add your Project ID, Clarity will start tracking:
- User sessions
- Heatmaps
- Session recordings
- User behavior analytics

## Current Status:
✅ Microsoft Clarity package installed
✅ Clarity component created
✅ Integrated into app layout
⏳ Waiting for Clarity Project ID to be added
