# Building Modern Web Apps: Best Practices for 2024

The web development landscape is constantly evolving. Here are the best practices you should follow in 2024 to build exceptional web applications.

## 1. Prioritize Performance

Performance isn't just about speedâ€”it's about creating a smooth, responsive experience for your users.

### Core Web Vitals

Focus on the three key metrics:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Aim for under 2.5 seconds
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Keep it under 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Maintain a score below 0.1

### Optimization Techniques

```typescript
// Example: Lazy load components
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false,
});
```

## 2. Embrace Component-Based Architecture

Break your application into reusable, self-contained components. This approach improves:
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug
- **Reusability**: Write once, use everywhere
- **Testability**: Test components in isolation

## 3. Implement Proper Error Handling

Never let errors crash your entire application. Use error boundaries and proper try-catch blocks.

```javascript
try {
  await fetchData();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
  showErrorToast('Something went wrong. Please try again.');
}
```

## 4. Security First

Always prioritize security in your applications:
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

## 5. Accessibility Matters

Build for everyone:
- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers
- Maintain proper color contrast

## 6. Optimize for Mobile

With mobile traffic dominating the web:
- Design mobile-first
- Use responsive layouts
- Optimize images for different screen sizes
- Test on real devices

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you build web applications that are fast, secure, accessible, and maintainable. Remember, the key is to continuously learn and adapt as the web evolves.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
